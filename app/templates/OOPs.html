            <p>What is Polymorphism ?
            </p>
            <p>
                Polymorphism gives a way to use a clas exactly like its parent so there's no confusion with mixing types.
                But each child class keeps its own methods as they are.
                This typically happens by defining a parent interface to be reused. It outlines a bunch of common methods.
                Then, each child class implements its own version of these methods.

                <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
                <p>
                    What is Encapsulation ?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private,
                    inside a class. Other objects don't have access to this state. Instead,
                    they can only call a list of public functions which are called methods.

            <h3>Abstraction</h3>
            <p>
                What is Abstractaion ?
            </p>
            <P>
                Abstraction can be thought of as a natural extension of encapsulation.
                In object-oriented design, programs are often extremely large, and separate
                objects communicate with each other a lot, so maintaining a large codebase
                like this for years - with changes along the way can be difficult. Abstraction is your solution
                to this problem.

                <h2>Inheritance</h2>
                <p>
                    What is Inheritance ?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.
                    The benefit is that it provides re-usability of a code.
