      <p>
        A test is a procedure that exercises a behavior to determine if the behavior functions correctly.
        There are several different kinds of tests, like unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests,
        but all functional tests do the same basic thing: they try something and report PASS or FAIL.
        On this page we will learn about AAA Testing which is a type of unit test written to make sure your programs
        basic functions are doing what it is supposed to do.

        <h2>ARRANGE</h2>
        <p>
          This is the first step in AAA Testing, which is to take the steps to set up the test which are the following:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Does the object require any objects or special settings ?</li>
          <li>Does it need to prep a database ?</li>
          <li>Does it need to log into a web app ? </li>
          <li>We need to answer all these questions before the start of the test</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

      <h3>ACT</h3>
      <P>
        ACT is the second step of AAA Unit testing this step covers the main thing that we need tested
        in our program. This is where you call/create your objects or methods that are needed to test
        the function hat you want.

        <h2>ASSERT</h2>
        <p>
          This is the last part of the testing, this is where you give the test an expected outcome.
          Whether the test is made to pass or fail, this is where you give the test an answer that you want to test
          and see if it passes or fails per your expectations.
